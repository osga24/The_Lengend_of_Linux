Link finally solved the first riddle in the endless darkness of the data world and found the legendary first FLAG. As he touched the FLAG, the surroundings sparkled with a soft light, seemingly enveloping him in a glow. The light slowly dissipated, leaving behind a mysterious message that appeared before him:

"Hero, this is just the beginning of your journey. True power lies hidden in the Forest of Mirrors, where only there can you find the true Master Sword. Seek the brilliance of that sword to vanquish the forces of darknessâ€”this is your destined mission."

With renewed courage ignited in his heart, Link knew this was a fresh start, and a new adventure awaited him. Guided by the FLAG, he set off on his journey toward the Forest of Mirrors, filled with anticipation for the unknown.
